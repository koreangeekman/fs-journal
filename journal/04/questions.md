# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | synchronous code runs top-down without waiting for any delayed results, asynchronous allows the code to wait for a result before continuing on to the next line of code   |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > | prepend an 'async' keyword before the function |

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
