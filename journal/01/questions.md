# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | As a method of maintaining a decentralized but synchronizable versioned set of updates for code changes |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | to create a directory |

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | 'interactive' actions providing dynamic reactions against specified elements. eg. hover, click, visited, nth-child, not |

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | determines the degree of priority a style's value has - can override generically applied formats with a more specific one depending on use cases |

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | losing track on where a particular style is being applied, unable to 'globally' affect all within a set upon a change request |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > | selector, property, value |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | a good design can provide ease of access reducing resistance to browsing/perusing more content on the site and increase levels of trust in continuing to use and even return or in the case of e-commerce, to buy from that site |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | the bones of an app/webpage |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | Absolutely! Going in blind without an idea of how to frame the UI can lead to a bunch of unnecessary work or wasted time going in the wrong direction or focus while coding |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | styles attributes that allow for more easily defined zones and the manipulation of objects within them |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | margin + padding |
