# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern
01. What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
  
  > | abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism |

02. How does `export` differ from `export default`?
  
  > | 'Export default' only exports a single value while 'export' allows multiple values to be exported |

03. What is Encapsulation?
  
  > | the combination of functions into one single component |

04. What are some of the benefits of the `Proxy` object that we are using in our structure for applications?
  
  > | prevents direct access to the object and can provide a template to construct from |

05. What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
  
  > | a 'class' is a template for creating objects while an instance of a 'class' is an object that was defined/constructed by a class |

06. What is a computed Property?
  
  > | functional properties that do not accept input and can update automatically when a dependency changes |

07. What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
  
  > | architects a standard model we can use to build out consistent and scalable content in a predictable and maintainable fashion |

08. What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
  
  > | to handle user input and manipulate the DOM |

09. What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
  
  > | any action that manipulates the data - a middle-man between the controller and model |

10. What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
  
  > | to define, declare and store data centric to the entire web application - a 'blueprint' of the data |
